# MolCondMeasurements
Data acquisition and analysis in the context of molecule evaporation and conductivity measurements.

This is a toolbox consisting of several programs developed during my master thesis in nanoscience. Most are targeted towards very specific problems encountered while working with partly lab-made devices. 

- The program `QuartzMicrobalance.py` is written for automization and remote data recording from a tectra Quartz Microbalance. The connection is established via an intellemetrics^TM^ IL150 Quartz Crystal Rate Monitor using a serial port.
