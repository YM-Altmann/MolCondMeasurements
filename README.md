# MolCondMeasurements
Data acquisition and analysis in the context of molecule evaporation and conductivity measurements.

This is a toolbox consisting of several programs developed during my master thesis in nanoscience. Most are targeted towards very specific problems encountered while working with partly lab-made devices.
